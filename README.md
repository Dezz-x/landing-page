# The Odin Project: Landing Page

For this project I was tasked with creating a static website using HTML and CSS. Over the course of the project I practiced my understanding of the box-model and took advantage of some more intermediate layout mechanics such as flexbox. Although this website is not set up for mobile currently, I plan on revisiting this project in the future in order to make it more mobile-friendly.
